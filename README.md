## How it works:
- Open an image from your laptop and/or mobile phone.
- Choose the number of columns and rows you want.
- This creates a stand-alone HTML file that you can either play directly in your browser, save to your device, share and/or self-host.

## Why it's privacy-friendly
- It can be used and played entirely offline by downloading files to your laptop.
- All data processing - compressing images, cutting the puzzle and generating the HTML code - is done on your device.
- I don't use cookies or content delivery networks (CDNs) and don't personally collect usage data. This is why you can play immediately without clicking on an "I agree" button.
